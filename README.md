## Reflect Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM 
- pthyon SQL toolkit and object relational mapper(downloaded sqlalchemy, session, create_engine and metadata)
- link the resources to the code
- create the database for the new model, reflect the tables and view all the classes found under automap
- save the references for the links under measurement and station
## Exploratory Precipitation Analysis 
- using the link to measurement- order the dates in descending
- date range- periods and frequency
- precipiation- date range- random(round)
- most recent date- date max
- one year ago - most recent date- subtract the number of days
- last 12 month data- calculate the percipitation data is more than one year ago
- sort the data by date- sort the values by date
- using pandas plot the bar graph
-simulating percipiatation dataset- a summary table of the total count, mean, std, and min and max
## Exploratory Station Analysis 
-station list - based on station id 
-groupby and order by - station and descending 
- print the station ID and count
- stats- lowest temperature, highest temperature and average temperature- calulated
- the temperature vs frequency plot the graph using pandas and dataframe
- closing the session

## App.py (api) 
-created the link to the resources- for measurement and station 
-created different api routes 
-precipitation= the latest date, latest date and start date - results from precipitation dictionary 
-the station query, the latest date order by descending - from the start date to late date 
-api start and end date- calculated the function of max, min and avg 
-run the function using the terminal( please note there are some errors- tried my best to fix them)
